#THE FILE MUC_SMOG20.GRO IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FILES:

head -9999 muc2_smog20.gro > muc2_smog20_head.gro

sed '1,9999d' muc2_smog20.gro > muc2_smog20_tail.gro

#THE FILE MUC2_SMOG20_MOD.GRO IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS, TO DIVIDE THE DEFINATION, BONDS AND THE OTHERS BECAUSE I NEED TO INCORPORATE LINES AFTER THE BONDS AND DEFINATIONS

head -40418 muc2_smog20_mod.top > muc2_smog20_mod_head.top

head -77868 muc2_smog20_mod.top > muc2_smog20_mod_body1.top

sed '1,40419d' muc2_smog20_mod_body1.top > muc2_smog20_mod_body.top
 
rm muc2_smog20_mod_body1.top

sed '1,77869d' muc2_smog20_mod.top > muc2_smog20_mod_tail.top

#I WILL NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES IN THE TAIL FILE BUT WOULD MAKE CHANGES IN THE HEAD AND BODY OF TOPOLOGY FILE

#FIRST START WITH MUC2_SMOG20_HEAD.GRO, GLYCAN_PR.PY FINDS SITES WITH SERINE OR THREONINE, SELECTS 50% OF THOSE SITES RANDOMLY, WHERE SUGARS ARE TO BE ATTACHED

python3 glycan_pr.py (THE OUTPUT FILE IS GLYCAN_PR.TXT)

#MUC2_SMOG20_HEAD.GRO CONTAINS BEADS 1-9999, BUT 1-16884 BEADS ARE BODY BEADS, WE DON NOT WANT TO ADD SUGARS AT THESE PLACES

python3 glycan_pr.py (THE OUTPUT FILE IS GLYCAN_PR.TXT, INPUT FILE = MUC2_SMOG20_TAIL.GRO)

#AFTER GENERATING THE SITES WHERE SUGARS ARE TO BE ATTACHED WE RAN A PROGRAM NAMED ATTACH_FINAL.PY WHICH GENERATES A .GRO FILE WHERE THE CO-ORDINATES WOULD BE THERE,
AND A DEF FILE WHERE THEIR DEFINATIONS IN THE TOPOLOGY FILE WOULD BE PRESENT, A BOND FILE WHERE THE BONDS WOULD BE PRESENT

python3 attach_final.py
